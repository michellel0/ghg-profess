**Legislative Professionalization and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Mandates**

**Overview**

This project investigates whether legislative professionalization influences the likelihood of state legislatures adopting greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction mandates. The analysis explores whether professionalized legislatures—characterized by greater policymaking capacity and constituent representation—are more likely to pass climate policies. Using a quantitative logit model, this study examines the relationship between legislative professionalization, partisan control, and the presence of GHG reduction mandates.

This code was conducted as a final project for POLI 406 at UNC-Chapel Hill, taught by Dr. Kroeger in the Political Science Department.

**Research Question**

Does legislative professionalization predict the likelihood of a state legislature enacting statutory GHG reduction mandates?

**Data Sources****

- National Conference of State Legislatures & Center for Climate and Energy Solutions: Data on state GHG reduction mandates

- 2021 Squire Index: Measures legislative professionalization

- Ballotpedia: Data on Democratic trifectas

- U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: Percentage of GDP derived from mining

**Variables**

- Dependent Variable: Presence of a statutory GHG reduction mandate (binary: 1 = present, 0 = absent)

- Independent Variable: Legislative professionalization (Squire Index)

- Control Variables: Democratic trifecta status (binary: 1 = Democratic control, 0 = otherwise); Percentage of GDP derived from mining

**Regression Models**

- Bivariate Logit Model: Examines the relationship between legislative professionalization and GHG mandates.

- Multivariate Logit Model: Adds Democratic trifectas as a control variable.

- Expanded Multivariate Model: Incorporates GDP derived from mining as an additional control variable.

- Interaction Model: Tests whether the effect of legislative professionalization on GHG mandates is moderated by Democratic trifectas.

**Key Findings
**
- Legislative professionalization alone is positively associated with the presence of GHG reduction mandates but lacks statistical significance when controlling for partisan influences.

- Democratic trifectas are a strong and statistically significant predictor of GHG reduction mandates, suggesting that partisan control plays a crucial role in climate policymaking.

- GDP from mining does not significantly predict GHG reduction mandates, though states with high mining dependence tend to have lower professionalization levels and are less likely to pass climate policies.

- No significant interaction was found between legislative professionalization and Democratic trifectas, indicating that professionalization's impact on GHG mandates does not depend on partisan control.

**Limitations**

- The study only establishes correlation, not causation, as it does not confirm that professionalization precedes policy adoption.

- Other potential factors, such as urbanization, public opinion, and lobbying regulations, were not included.

- The study analyzes a single time point rather than policy changes over time.
